**Dashboard and Insights - Eurovision 1975-2019**

Upcoming 2023 Eurovision Song Contest inspired me to gather relevant data and build a dashboard that answers following quations: 
* Who has won the most number of times?
* Which song and artist are the top of all the times?
* How did introducing free choice in terms of language of perfomnace increased english share, when it happeded and how does the trend look now?
* Does songs in english tend to win or just the opposite? 
* Do jury and viewers always agree?
* Does geografical and cultural closeness influence the voting? If so, who is more biased - jury or viewers? 

These and many more quations can be answered based on my interactive dashboard. On the last page you can find some facts and my conclusions (some answers to above quations - spoiler ðŸ˜‰) that I came to while using this dashboard.

During process of designing and building this dashboard I faced and tackles some challenges and learned new features of Power BI (and have a lot of fun as well ðŸ˜Š). 

Technologies used:
* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query
